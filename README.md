# TYPESCRIPT-ECOMMERCE-APP
Ecommerce App Using TypeScript and React

Completely functioning e-commerce application project

Things I learned:
  How to parse JSON data
  useContext to deal with state
  Defining many different types with TypeScript
  Clean and organized code 
  Use a utilities folder to clean up code and remove as much logic from components as possible
  Bootstrap (specifically React-Bootstrap)
  ViteJs
  Rendering components using loops
  
 Hardest part of coding this project:
  Parsing the JSON data: {
    Because the JSON file was an array of objects that contained arrays, I had to use the following methods:
      flat()
      entries()
      Object.getOwnPropertyNames()
    }
    
  Overall, very informative project. Looking forward to doing more in the future. 
  
  P.S. Currently looking for any hands on experience in the industry (internships, junior level web development positions).
